# interview-prep
I started this repository as a place to put solutions to practice/leetcode problems with write ups so I could go back and reference my thoughts.  Hopefully it can help others as well.  I also wanted to learn a new programming language or two; re-writing the solutions in a different language seemed like a reasonable start.

# Problems
The problems are in the [Problems](./Problems) directory, where each one is listed by name. In each problem directory is a readme file containing hints and some tips on how to think about the problem. The solutions are in the problem directory in the various languages I attempted it in (so far, just Python and Go).

# Data Structures
More to follow on this!
